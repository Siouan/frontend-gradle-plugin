## Requirements

The plugin supports:
- [Gradle][gradle] 5.1+
- [JDK][jdk] 8+ 64 bits
- [Node][node] 6.2.1+
- [Yarn][yarn] 1.0.0+

## Installation

### Activation

2 options are available.

#### Using [Gradle DSL][gradle-dsl]

This is the modern and recommended approach.

```gradle
// build.gradle
plugins {
    id 'org.siouan.frontend' version '1.1.1'
}
```

#### Using [Gradle build script block][gradle-build-script-block]

This approach is the legacy way to resolve and apply plugins.

```gradle
// build.gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.siouan:frontend-gradle-plugin:1.1.1'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'org.siouan.frontend'
```

### Configuration

#### DSL reference

All settings are introduced hereafter, with default value for each property.

```gradle
// build.gradle
frontend {
    // NODE SETTINGS
    // Version of the distribution to download, used to build the URL to download the distribution, if not set.
    nodeVersion = '10.15.3'

    // [Optional] Sets this property to force the download from a custom website. By default, this property is 'null',
    // and the plugin attempts to download the distribution compatible with the current platform from the Node website.
    nodeDistributionUrl = 'https://nodejs.org/dist/vX.Y.Z/node-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip'

    // [Optional] Install directory where the distribution archive shall be exploded.
    nodeInstallDirectory = "${projectDir}/node"

    // YARN SETTINGS
    // Whether Yarn shall be used instead of NPM when executing frontend tasks. Consequently, a Yarn distribution will
    // be downloaded and installed by the plugin.
    yarnEnabled = false

    // Yarn version, used to build the URL to download the corresponding distribution, if not set. If a custom
    // 'yarnDistributionUrl' property is set, the version of the distribution is expected to be the same as the one set
    // in the 'yarnVersion' property, or this may lead to unexpected results. This property is mandatory when the
    // property 'yarnEnabled' is true.
    yarnVersion = '1.15.2'

    // [Optional] Sets this property to force the download from a custom website. By default, this property is 'null',
    // and the plugin attempts to download the distribution compatible with the current platform from the Yarn website.
    yarnDistributionUrl = 'https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/yarn-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz'

    // [Optional] Install directory where the distribution archive shall be exploded.
    yarnInstallDirectory = "${projectDir}/yarn"

    // OTHER SETTINGS
    // Name of the NPM/Yarn scripts (see 'package.json' file) that shall be executing depending on the Gradle lifecycle
    // task. The values below are passed as argument of the 'npm' or 'yarn' executable.

    // [Optional] Use this property only if frontend's compiled resources are generated out of the '${project.buildDir}'
    // directory. Default value is <null>. This property is directly used by the 'cleanFrontend' task. The task is
    // run when the Gradle built-in 'clean' task is run.
    cleanScript = 'run clean'

    // [Optional] Script called to build frontend's artifacts. Default value is <null>. This property is directly used
    // by the 'assembleFrontend' task. The task also run when the Gradle built-in 'assemble' task is run.
    assembleScript = 'run assemble'

    // [Optional] Script called to run frontend's tests. Default value is <null>. This property is directly used by the
    // 'checkFrontend' task. The task is run when the Gradle built-in 'check' task is run.
    checkScript = 'run check'
}
```

#### Typical configuration with NPM

```gradle
// build.gradle
frontend {
    nodeVersion = '<X.Y.Z>'
    cleanScript = 'run clean'
    assembleScript = 'run assemble'
    checkScript = 'run check'
}
```

#### Typical configuration with Yarn

```gradle
// build.gradle
frontend {
    yarnEnabled = true
    nodeVersion = '<X.Y.Z>'
    yarnVersion = '<X.Y.Z>'
    cleanScript = 'run clean'
    assembleScript = 'run assemble'
    checkScript = 'run check'
}
```

### Final steps

#### Install Node/NPM/Yarn/frontend dependencies

Working with the frontend application requires the Node distribution, the Yarn distribution - if enabled, and 
the frontend dependencies declared in the `package.json` file are all installed/up-to-date. If this is not the case, it
is recommended to run the `installFrontend` task. Open a terminal, and execute the following command in the project's
directory:

```sh
gradlew installFrontend
```

#### Use Node/NPM/Yarn apart from Gradle
 
If Node/NPM/Yarn may be used apart from Gradle, it is mandatory to apply the following steps:

- Create a `NODEJS_HOME` environment variable containing the real path set in the `nodeInstallDirectory` property.
- Add the `$NODEJS_HOME` (Unix-like OS) or `%NODEJS_HOME%` (Windows OS) path to the `PATH` environment variable.

If Yarn is enabled, apply also the steps below:

- Create a `YARN_HOME` environment variable containing the real path set in the `yarnInstallDirectory` property.
- Add the `$YARN_HOME/bin` (Unix-like OS) or `%YARN_HOME%\bin` (Windows OS) path to the `PATH`
environment variable.

## Tasks reference

The plugin registers multiple tasks, some having dependencies with other, and also with Gradle lifecycle tasks defined
in the [Gradle base plugin][gradle-base-plugin].

### Dependencies

![Task dependencies][task-dependencies]

### Install Node

The `installNode` task downloads a Node distribution. If the `distributionUrl` property is ommitted, the URL is
guessed using the `version` property. Use the property `nodeInstallDirectory` to set the directory where the
distribution shall be installed, which, by default is the `${projectDir}/node` directory.

This task should not be executed directly. It will be called automatically by Gradle, if another task depends on it.
 
### Install Yarn

The `installYarn` task downloads a Yarn distribution, if `yarnEnabled` property is `true`. If the `distributionUrl`
property is ommitted, the URL is guessed using the `version` property. Use the property `yarnInstallDirectory` to set
the directory where the distribution shall be installed, which, by default is the `${projectDir}/yarn` directory.

This task should not be executed directly. It will be called automatically by Gradle, if another task depends on it.
 
### Install frontend dependencies

Depending on the value of the `yarnEnabled` property, the `installFrontend` task issues either a `npm install` command
or a `yarn install` command. If a `package.json` file is found in the project's directory, the command shall install
dependencies and tools for frontend development.

This task may be executed directly, especially if the Node distribution and/or the Yarn distribution must be downloaded
again.

### Clean frontend

The `cleanFrontend` task does nothing by default, considering frontend generated resources (pre-processed Typescript
files, SCSS stylesheets...) are written in the `${project.buildDir}` directory. If it is not the case, this task may be
useful to clean the relevant directory. To do so, a clean script must be defined in the project's `package.json` file,
and the `cleanScript` property must be set to the corresponding NPM/Yarn command.

### Assemble frontend

The `assembleFrontend` task shall be used to integrate a frontend's build script into Gradle builds. The build script
must be defined in the project's `package.json` file, and the `assembleScript` property must be set to the corresponding
NPM/Yarn command.

### Check frontend

The `checkFrontend` task shall be used to integrate a frontend's check script into Gradle builds. The check script must
be defined in the project's `package.json` file, and the `checkscript` property must be set with the corresponding
NPM/Yarn command. A typical check script defined in the project's `package.json` file may lint frontend source files,
execute tests, and perform additional analysis tasks.

### Run custom NPM/Yarn script

The `runScriptFrontend` task is provided as a task type, to create custom tasks. The `script` property must be set with
the corresponding NPM/Yarn command. For instance, the code below added in the `build.gradle` file allows to run
frontend's end-to-end tests in a custom task:

```gradle
tasks.register('e2e', org.siouan.frontendgradleplugin.tasks.RunScriptTask) {
    dependsOn tasks.named('installFrontend')
    script = 'run e2e'
}
```

## Usage guidelines

The following guidelines

### How to assemble a frontend and a Java backend in a single artifact?

If you plan to serve your frontend with a Java backend (e.g. a [Spring Boot][spring-boot] application), you will
probably use other Gradle plugins, such as the [Gradle Java plugin][gradle-java-plugin], the
[Gradle Spring Boot plugin][gradle-spring-boot-plugin], or other ones of your choice.

In this configuration, you may package your full-stack application as a JAR/WAR artifact. To do so, the frontend must be
assembled before the backend, and generally provided in a special directory for the backend packaging task (e.g.
`jar`/`war`/`bootJar`/`bootWar`... tasks). 

Assembling the frontend before the backend shall not be difficult to setup in Gradle. Below is the task tree of the
`assemble` task when this plugin is used with the [Gradle Java plugin][gradle-java-plugin] or a plugin depending on it:

```sh
gradlew taskTree --no-repeat assemble

:build
:assemble
+--- :assembleFrontend
|    \--- :installFrontend
|         +--- :installNode
|         \--- :installYarn
+--- :jar
     \--- :classes
          +--- :compileJava
          \--- :processResources
```

1. Considering the frontend assembling script generates the frontend artifacts (HTML, CSS, JS...) in the
`${frontendBuildDir}` directory, these artifacts must be copied, generally in the
`${project.buildDir}/resources/main/public` directory, so as they can be served by the backend.

Let's create a custom task for this. Add the following lines in the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
tasks.register('processFrontendResources', Copy) {
    description 'Process frontend resources'
    from "${frontendBuildDir}"
    into "${project.buildDir}/resources/main/public"
    dependsOn tasks.named('assembleFrontend')
}
```

Finally, you should:

- Replace the `${frontendBuildDir}` variable by any relevant directory, depending on where the frontend artifacts are
generated by your assembling script.
- Adapt the target directory under `${project.buildDir}/resources/main`, depending on the Java artifact built.

2. The frontend must be assembled and the generated resources must be copied before the backend packaging task.

Our recommendation is the `processResources` task depends on the `processFrontendResources` task.

```groovy
tasks.named('processResources').configure {
    dependsOn tasks.named('processFrontendResources')
}
```

### What kind of script should I attach to the `checkFrontend` task?

The `checkFrontend` task is a dependency of the `check` task. The Gradle official documentation states that the `check`
task shall be used to `attach [...] verification tasks, such as ones that run tests [...]`. It's enough vague to let you
consider any verification task. The script mapped to the `checkFrontend` task may run either automated unit tests, or
functional tests, or a linter, or any other verification action, or even combine some or all of them. Every combination
is possible, since you can define a script in your `package.json` file that executes sequentially the actions of your
choice.
